# This alias control file is processed on EVERY SINGLE message.
# ***THINK*** before you do this as it can put extra load on your system.
#
# Several things can be done here:
# 1. Record EVERY single message in a mailbox file.
#    *** ARE YOU SURE YOU ***REALLY*** WANT TO RECORD EVERY SINGLE MESSAGE!!!???
#    EXAMPLE:
#./msglog
#
# 2. Record Message-IDs for later tracking.
#    EXAMPLE:
#| awk '/^$/ { exit } /^[mM][eE][sS][sS][aA][gG][eE]-/ { print }'
