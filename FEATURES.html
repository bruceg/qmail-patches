<p><b>qmail</b> is a secure, reliable, efficient, simple message
transfer agent.
It is meant as a replacement for the entire sendmail-binmail system on
typical Internet-connected UNIX hosts.

<p>This is (and will be) a source-only RPM of the main qmail package
with several patches from the above web page added.  This directory
contains all all the source files used to create the RPM.

<p><b>Features of this package:</b>
<ul>
<li>Support for sending and receiving via QMTP
  (patch to qmail-remote by Russell Nelson).
<li>Support for sending more than 255 simultaneous messages
  (big-concurrency patch by Johannes Erdfelt).
<li>Support for faster processing when large quantities of mail arrive
  (ext-todo patch by André Oppermann and big-todo patch by Russell Nelson).
<li>Startup scripts set limits on daemon's CPU time and
  data size to avoid denial-of-service attacks.
<li>Integrated optional RBL blocking support from multiple servers.
<li>UID/GID numbers are configured into a set of control files instead
  of hard-coded in the binaries.  This would allow a binary RPM to be
  distributed unmodified to any setup.
<li>The qmail run script uses the contents of
  <samp>/etc/qmail/control/aliasempty</samp> for the aliasempty argument to
  qmail-start
<li>Message logging is done via the string in
  <samp>/etc/qmail/control/logger</samp>
<li>qmail-showctl shows the contents of all the control files used in
  this package
<li>Intelligent login scripts (<samp>/etc/profile.d/qmail.sh</samp> and
  <samp>/etc/profile.d/qmail.tcsh</samp>).
<li>A man page documenting the control files used by all the init scripts
<li>All the network daemons use tcpserver to manage connections
<li>Support for binding outgoing connections to local interfaces
  (patch to qmail-remote by Chuck Foster).
<li>Evan Champion's patch to conredirect, ported to qmail-1.03
<li>A fix for broken CR/LF conventions on SMTP connections using
  <samp>fixcrio</samp>, which doesn't require a patch to qmail.
